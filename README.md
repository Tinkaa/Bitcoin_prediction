In this project, we use Gaussian Processes to predict bitcoin, forcing a weekly trend.
This project was done for the course Gaussian Processes at Aalto University (2018)

Bitcoin is a popular cryptocurrency and hence there is a interest in predicting the future price. Among cryptocurrency enthusiasts there is a belief that the price of Bitcoin follows a weekly trend, where the price goes up during weekdays and drops during weekends. This research aims to discover if forcing such periodicity would yield evidence of the
trend or if it would improve the prediction accuracy of the Bitcoin price. For predictions, Gaussian Pro-
cesses are used. This method is chosen since it is well suited for time series prediction and can easily be forced to include a periodicity. We conclude that adding periodicity doesnâ€™t improve the prediction significantly. The results suggest that this is due to a lack of a strong periodicity in the data.
